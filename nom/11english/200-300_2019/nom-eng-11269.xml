    <a>The teacher groups the students and asks each group to choose an environmental problem. The students reflect on
       the problem and propose solutions for it. Each group presents their proposals to the rest of the class.</a>
    <a>The teacher provides the students with a dialogue between two friends talking about environmental problems. The
       teacher pairs up the students and assigns each student a role. The students practice the dialogue for some
       minutes.</a>
    <a>The teacher writes the following questions on the board: "Which environmental problem is affecting our country
       nowadays?" and "Have the authorities adopted environmental policies to solve that problem?" The students
       exchange their answers in pairs.</a>
