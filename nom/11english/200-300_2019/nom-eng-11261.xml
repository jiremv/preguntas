  <as r="R" correcta="2">
    <a>The teacher pairs up the students and assigns them a role. Student A is a foreigner who gets lost and student B
       is a local citizen. The foreigner asks how to get to some specific places in town and the local citizen gives him
       directions.</a>
    <a>The teacher displays, on the board, a map of the neighborhood showing places and their locations. She writes
       prompts such as: "How do I get...?", "Go straight", "Turn left", etc. In pairs, the students ask
       for and give directions to get to some of those places.</a>
    <a>The teacher gives each student a conversation between a police officer and a tourist who is asking for
       directions. She tells them to practice the conversation with different classmates changing some prepositions and
       places every time they talk to a new peer.</a>
