    <a>"The content of your writing is ok. However, there are some punctuation mistakes in it. I have included commas
       and periods where necessary."</a>
    <a>"The message is clear, but you haven't used commas and periods adequately. Remember commas help you separate
       clauses and periods introduce new ideas."</a>
    <a>"The purpose of inviting someone was achieved. On the other hand, what do you think about the punctuation? How
       can you improve the flow of your message?"</a>
