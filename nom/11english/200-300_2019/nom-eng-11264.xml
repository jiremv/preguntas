  <q0>After having been working on the topic "daily routines" for some sessions, Guillermo wants his students to
      develop their oral fluency on that topic. He puts the students in pairs and gives each pair a picture of a famous
      singer. He asks them to take turns describing the singer's daily routine. While monitoring, the teacher notices
      that a couple of students say the following sentences: "He is get up at 10:00 am" and "He don't have to
      work."</q0>
