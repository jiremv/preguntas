        <a>The teacher brings bingo cards with the words she wants the students to practice. She gives a bingo card to
           each student and reads the words aloud for the students to mark them down in their cards. Finally, she asks
           the students to pronounce the words as they have heard them some minutes ago.</a>
        <a>The teacher writes on the board the words she wants the students to practice and reads them while trying to
           emphasize their correct pronunciation. After that, she asks the students to repeat each word after her.
           Finally, she points at the words randomly and all the students pronounce them at the same time.</a>
        <a>The teacher writes three tongue twisters on the board. She reads them aloud and has the students repeat them
           after her. Then she puts the students in pairs and asks them to practice those tongue twisters. Finally, they
           make their own tongue twister using some of the words they find more difficult to pronounce and present it to
           the class.</a>
