    <as r="R" correcta="1">
        <a>The teacher pastes three titles for the story on the board: "The most exciting adventure ever", "The scariest
           experience in my life" and "The most difficult activity I have done." Next, he asks the students to work in
           pairs to select one of the titles as a guess for the listening they are about to hear.</a>
        <a>The teacher writes on the board four words related to the audio: "adventure", "trip", "water" and "rapids."
           In pairs, the students use those words to discuss the possible context in which the story they are about to
           hear will take place. Then the teacher asks the students to present their ideas to the rest of the class.</a>
        <a>The teacher sticks a picture of a person doing bungee jumping and writes two questions on the board: "What
           activity is the person doing?" and "Do you think the activity is safe or dangerous?" Next, the students have
           one minute to think about possible answers. Finally, the teacher elicits the students' answers and writes the
           most common ones on the board.</a>
