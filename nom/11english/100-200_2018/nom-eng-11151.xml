  <q>Franco's second graders have been practicing describing family relationships. He shows the students a picture of a
     family tree and tells them to describe the family relationships orally using possessive nouns. The students
     practice in pairs, and then the teacher calls on volunteers. During the practice, one student comes up with the
     following example: "Homer is Lisa father."</q>
  <g></g>
  <q2>Aware of the situation, Franco wants to use an appropriate technique to correct the student's mistake on the spot.
      Given Franco's goal, which of the following actions is most appropriate?</q2>
  <g2></g2>
  <as r="R" correcta="1">
    <a>Indicate the mistake by saying "that's not quite right." Then ask another student to say the correct form.</a>
    <a>Echo the student's sentence emphasizing the mistake to draw the learner's attention to it. Then ask the student
       to say the sentence again.</a>
    <a>Ignore the student's mistake and let him finish. Then when all the students finish participating, remind them the
       use of the apostrophe to indicate possession.</a>
