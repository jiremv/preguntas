        <a>Present a matching exercise for the students to connect the words they don't understand with their
           definitions. Then ask the students to stand up and compare their answers with at least five different
           classmates.</a>
        <a>Show the students the tape script of the news report and ask them to highlight the words they don't
           understand. Tell them to focus on the context in which those words appear to find out their meaning.</a>
        <a>Organize the students in groups and give them a dictionary. Ask them to work together on two activities: (1)
           look up the meaning of the words they do not understand from the audio of the news report and (2) make two
           sentences using each word.</a>
