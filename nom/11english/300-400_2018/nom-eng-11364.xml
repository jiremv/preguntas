  <as r="R" correcta="1">
    <a>The teacher tells the students to make a list of either the pros or cons of social networking and add some
       arguments such as examples or opinions to support their ideas. Then he asks two students with different points of
       view to get together. Finally, he asks them to have a short discussion on the topic.</a>
    <a>The teacher writes the title "Social networking" on the board. Then he asks as many students as possible to go to
       the board and write words related to that title. Finally, the teacher pairs up the students and tells them to
       take turns to speak about social networking for one minute using the words from the board.</a>
    <a>The teacher writes the following questions on the board: "What social networking sites do you use?", "What
       information do you have on those sites?" and "What are some good/bad points about social networking?" Then he
       puts the students in groups and tells them to discuss their answers. Finally, the students share their findings
       with the class.</a>
