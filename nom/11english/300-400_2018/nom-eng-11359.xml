  <as r="R" correcta="1">
    <a>The teacher tells one student to come to the front of the classroom and sit down, facing his classmates. The
       teacher writes the name of a personal belonging on the board, and tells the student to ask his classmates yes/no
       questions to try to guess the name of the object. His classmates must give short responses.</a>
    <a>The teacher asks the students to bring a personal belonging. They sit in groups and one student shows his object
       to his peers and they ask him questions such as: "How did you get the object?", "Why do you like it?", "When did
       you get it?", etc. The student answers his classmates' questions. Once there are no more questions, they swap
       roles.</a>
    <a>The teacher pastes a list with the names of different kinds of personal belongings on the walls outside the
       classroom. The students sit in pairs. One student runs outside, reads one word and runs back to dictate the word
       to his partner. His partner writes the word and then they swap roles. They stop when they've written all the
       words from the list.</a>
