    <a>The teacher draws three columns on the board and labels them as follows: (1) first aid technique, (2) steps to
       apply it and (3) pictures to include in the brochure. The teacher elicits some ideas to complete the first
       column. Next, the students complete the other columns with information related to the topic.</a>
    <a>The teacher inquires the students about first aid techniques they know and how to put them into practice. On the
       board, he summarizes the students' ideas using words and phrases. Then the students write complete sentences
       using the information written on the board. Next, in pairs, the students organize the sentences in their
       brochures.</a>
    <a>The teacher tells the students to make a list of first aid techniques they are familiarized with to be included
       in their brochures. Then he asks the following questions: "What's the purpose of your brochure?", "Who is it
       written for?" and "What sources can you use?" The students discuss the questions and share their answers with the
       rest of the class.</a>
