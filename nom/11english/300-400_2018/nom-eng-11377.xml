  <as r="R" correcta="2">
    <a>The students' oral performance shouldn't have been evaluated by their peers because evaluations need pretty
       accurate judgment. This evaluation should have been done by the teacher.</a>
    <a>The setting for this oral sequence shouldn't have been a debate because debates are complex and require high
       command of the language. The setting for assessments should be simple and easy.</a>
    <a>The debaters shouldn't have been assessed only on their overall performance. The judges should have been provided
       with an assessment tool that helps them evaluate different aspects of the debaters' performance.</a>
